# P2 Simple Scene Generation
***A project that use 2D drawing to redraw "the inspiring image" by using javascript.***

In my scene, I used randomness in the position and color of the flowers, the position of the trees and the shape of the mountain, because in the inspiring image, the picture locked in a position which give us a view of blurred flowers, trees and mountains, therefore what I was trying to do is after each roll, the train will be like it is in a new position where the views will be different because now the picture is locked in a different perspectives.

Since there is a train, the reacitivity of the scene must include the train in it, therefore when I construct the train with the shapes, the x position values where tied with the mouseX position. Also, the train road will also move with the mouse, but in order to let it feels like it is moving, I made the road's x position mouseX divided by 2, therefore the road will be moving but slower than the train, and it will be more vivid.

The effect I am trying to achieve is to use what is in the picture and simulate a scene that the train in the picture is moving and the view will be changing differently every reroll clicked. I believe I mostly achieved the goal, but because of it is 2D and the construction of the shapes will not perfectly performes what is in the picture, the scene is not perfect.
